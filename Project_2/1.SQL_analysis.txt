--Consumer Segment:
--Sales-Profit Correlation (-0.0637): There is a very weak negative correlation between sales and profit for the Consumer segment. This suggests that as sales increase, profit tends to decrease slightly, but the correlation is not strong.
--Sales-Quantity Correlation (0.0992): There is a weak positive correlation between sales and quantity for the Consumer segment. This means that as sales increase, the quantity of products sold also tends to increase slightly.
--Profit-Quantity Correlation (0.0435): There is a very weak positive correlation between profit and quantity for the Consumer segment. This suggests that as the quantity of products sold increases, profit tends to increase slightly, but the correlation is not strong.

--Corporate Segment:
--Sales-Profit Correlation (-0.0516): There is a very weak negative correlation between sales and profit for the Corporate segment. Similar to the Consumer segment, this suggests that as sales increase, profit tends to decrease slightly, but the correlation is not strong.
--Sales-Quantity Correlation (0.0925): There is a weak positive correlation between sales and quantity for the Corporate segment. As sales increase, the quantity of products sold also tends to increase slightly.
--Profit-Quantity Correlation (0.0815): There is a weak positive correlation between profit and quantity for the Corporate segment. As the quantity of products sold increases, profit tends to increase slightly.

--Home Office Segment:
--Sales-Profit Correlation (0.4270): There is a moderate positive correlation between sales and profit for the Home Office segment. This suggests that as sales increase, profit tends to increase significantly.
--Sales-Quantity Correlation (0.0827): There is a weak positive correlation between sales and quantity for the Home Office segment. As sales increase, the quantity of products sold also tends to increase slightly.
--Profit-Quantity Correlation (0.1002): There is a weak positive correlation between profit and quantity for the Home Office segment. As the quantity of products sold increases, profit tends to increase slightly.
